# Deploy a Node.js Project from GitHub on Ubuntu Server with Apache2, PM2, `yourdomain.in` Domain, and SSL

This guide walks you through the steps to host a Node.js project from a GitHub repository on an Ubuntu server, use PM2 for process management (with a custom project name), configure the domain **yourdomain.in** for accessing the application, and enable SSL using **Let's Encrypt** for secure HTTPS access, all using Apache2 as a reverse proxy.

## Prerequisites

- A blank Ubuntu server (Ubuntu 20.04 or later).
- SSH access to the server.
- A GitHub repository containing your Node.js project.
- A domain name **yourdomain.in** pointing to your serverâ€™s IP.
- Basic knowledge of using the command line.

## Step 0: SSH Login to the Server

To log in to your Ubuntu server via SSH, use the following command. Replace `your-server-ip` with the IP address of your server, and `your-username` with your username (e.g., `ubuntu` or `root`):

```bash
ssh your-username@your-server-ip
```

For example:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.1
```

If you're using an SSH key for authentication, make sure to specify the private key file with the `-i` option:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your/private-key.pem your-username@your-server-ip
```

## Step 1: Update and Upgrade the System

Before starting, make sure the server is up-to-date.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Step 2: Install Node.js and npm

1. **Install Node.js**

   To install the latest LTS version of Node.js, run the following commands:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt install -y nodejs
   ```

2. **Verify Installation**

   Check the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

## Step 3: Install PM2

PM2 is a process manager that helps you keep your Node.js application running in the background.

1. **Install PM2 globally**

   ```bash
   sudo npm install -g pm2
   ```

2. **Verify PM2 Installation**

   ```bash
   pm2 -v
   ```

## Step 4: Clone Your Node.js Project from GitHub

1. **Install Git (if not already installed)**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install git
   ```

2. **Clone the Project Repository**

   Replace `your-repository-url` with the URL of your GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/username/your-project.git`).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/your-project.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   ```

4. **Install Project Dependencies**

   If your project has a `package.json` file, install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Step 5: Run the Node.js Application with PM2

Now that your project is set up, start it using PM2.

1. **Start Your Application with PM2**

   Assuming your entry file is `app.js`, run:

   ```bash
   pm2 start app.js --name "your-app-name"
   ```

   Replace `"your-app-name"` with a name for your PM2 process (e.g., `"jemish-app"`). This helps you identify and manage the application more easily in PM2.

2. **Verify the Application is Running**

   To check the status of your Node.js app:

   ```bash
   pm2 list
   ```

3. **Save the PM2 Process List**

   To ensure the app restarts after reboot:

   ```bash
   pm2 save
   ```

## Step 6: Set Up PM2 to Auto-Start on Reboot

To ensure PM2 restarts your application after a server reboot, configure PM2 as a startup service.

1. **Generate the Startup Script**

   ```bash
   pm2 startup
   ```

2. **Follow the Instructions**

   The command above will display a command to execute. Follow the instructions and run that command.

3. **Save the PM2 Process List Again**

   ```bash
   pm2 save
   ```

## Step 7: Install Apache2

1. **Install Apache2**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install apache2
   ```

2. **Verify Apache Installation**

   Ensure that Apache2 is installed and running:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status apache2
   ```

## Step 8: Configure Apache2 as a Reverse Proxy

1. **Enable Apache2 Modules**

   Enable the necessary modules for proxying:

   ```bash
   sudo a2enmod proxy
   sudo a2enmod proxy_http
   sudo a2enmod rewrite
   ```

2. **Create a New Apache2 Configuration for Your Node.js App**

   Create a new configuration file for **yourdomain.in**:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/yourdomain.in.conf
   ```

   Add the following configuration, replacing `your_project_port` with the actual port your app is running on (e.g., `3000`):

   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName yourdomain.in
       ServerAlias www.yourdomain.in

       ProxyPreserveHost On
       ProxyPass / http://localhost:your_project_port/
       ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:your_project_port/

       ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
       CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

3. **Enable the New Site Configuration**

   Enable the configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo a2ensite yourdomain.in.conf
   ```

4. **Restart Apache2**

   Restart Apache2 to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

5. **Allow HTTP Traffic Through the Firewall**

   If you're using `ufw`, allow HTTP traffic:

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full'
   ```

## Step 9: Configure DNS for `yourdomain.in` Domain

To point your domain **yourdomain.in** to your server, update the DNS settings of your domain.

1. **Login to your Domain Registrarâ€™s Dashboard**

   - Go to the DNS management page for **yourdomain.in** (this might be through your domain registrar like GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.).

2. **Add an A Record**

   - Set up an A record to point your domain to your serverâ€™s public IP address.

     Example:
     - **Host**: `@`
     - **Type**: `A`
     - **Value**: Your serverâ€™s IP (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
     - **TTL**: `1 hour` (or leave default).

3. **DNS Propagation**

   It may take a few minutes to hours for the DNS changes to propagate.

## Step 10: Enable SSL with Let's Encrypt

To secure your website with HTTPS, you can use **Letâ€™s Encrypt** SSL certificates.

1. **Install Certbot and Apache Plugin**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache
   ```

2. **Obtain the SSL Certificate**

   Run the following command to obtain and install the SSL certificate for **yourdomain.in**:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot --apache -d yourdomain.in -d www.yourdomain.in
   ```

   Certbot will automatically obtain the SSL certificate and configure Apache2 for HTTPS.

3. **Confirm SSL Installation**

   Once the process is complete, Certbot will give you a success message. You can verify the SSL by visiting `https://yourdomain.in` in your browser.

4. **Automatic Certificate Renewal**

   Certbot will set up a cron job for automatic certificate renewal. You can test the renewal process by running:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

## Step 11: Access the Application

Now, your Node.js application should be accessible via **yourdomain.in** with HTTPS.

1. **Visit the Domain**

   Open your browser and go to `https://yourdomain.in`. You should see your Node.js app running securely over HTTPS.

## Step 12: Monitoring the Application

To monitor the logs of your Node.js application:

```bash
pm2 logs
```

## Conclusion

With these steps, you've successfully:

1. Logged into your server using SSH.
2. Cloned your Node.js project from GitHub.
3. Set up PM2 to manage the application with a custom process name (`your-app-name`).
4. Configured **yourdomain.in** domain to point to your server.
5. Set up Apache2 as a reverse proxy to route traffic to your Node.js app.
6. Enabled SSL with Letâ€™s Encrypt to serve your app over HTTPS.

To update the project in the future, you can simply pull the latest changes from GitHub:

```bash
git pull origin main
pm2 restart your-app-name
```
