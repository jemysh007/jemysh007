## 1. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

**JSON** is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.

### JSON Syntax:
- Data is written in key/value pairs.
- Curly braces `{}` hold objects, and square brackets `[]` hold arrays.

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false,
  "courses": ["Math", "English"]
}
```

### Working with JSON in JavaScript:

- **Stringify**: Convert JavaScript objects to JSON string.
- **Parse**: Convert JSON string to JavaScript object.

```js
const obj = { name: "John", age: 30, isStudent: false };
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);
console.log(jsonString);

const parsedObj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(parsedObj);
```

---

## 2. Classes and Objects

### Objects in JavaScript:
Objects are collections of key/value pairs.

```js
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  },
};

person.greet();
```

### Classes in JavaScript:
A class is a blueprint for creating objects.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const john = new Person("John", 30);
john.greet();
```

---

## 3. Callbacks

A **callback** is a function passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of some task.

```js
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
  callback();
}

function afterGreeting() {
  console.log("Hope you're having a great day!");
}

greet("John", afterGreeting);
```

---

## 4. Asynchronous JavaScript

**Asynchronous** JavaScript allows tasks to run in the background, letting the program continue executing other tasks without waiting for one to finish.

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Done!");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

---

## 5. Promises

A **Promise** represents a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved in the future.

```js
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let success = true;
  
  if (success) {
    resolve("Operation was successful!");
  } else {
    reject("Something went wrong!");
  }
});

myPromise
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.log(error));
```

---

## 6. Async/Await

**Async/Await** simplifies handling asynchronous code, making it look like synchronous code.

```js
async function fetchData() {
  const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1");
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}

fetchData();
```

---

## 7. Closures

A **closure** is a function that "remembers" its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope.

```js
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  
  function increment() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }
  
  return increment;
}

const counter = outer();
counter();
counter();
```

---

## 8. The `this` Keyword

**`this`** refers to the context in which a function is called.

```js
const person = {
  name: "John",
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  },
};

person.greet();
```

When used in a function, the value of `this` can change depending on the context. To avoid losing context, we can use `.bind()`, or arrow functions.

---

## 9. Event Delegation

**Event Delegation** is a technique to attach a single event listener to a parent element, which will handle events for child elements.

```js
const ul = document.querySelector('ul');
ul.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
    console.log(`You clicked on ${event.target.textContent}`);
  }
});
```

---

## 10. Destructuring

**Destructuring** allows you to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

### Object Destructuring:

```js
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name, age);
```

### Array Destructuring:

```js
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
const [first, second] = colors;
console.log(first, second);
```

---

## 11. Spread Operator (`...`)

The **spread operator** allows you to unpack elements from arrays or properties from objects into individual elements. It can also be used to merge arrays or objects.

### Example with Arrays:

```js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5];
console.log(arr2);
```

### Example with Objects:

```js
const obj1 = { name: "John", age: 30 };
const obj2 = { ...obj1, city: "New York" };
console.log(obj2);
```

---

## 12. Generators and Iterators

**Generators** are special functions that can pause and resume execution, yielding multiple values over time.

```js
function* countUpTo(max) {
  let count = 1;
  while (count <= max) {
    yield count;
    count++;
  }
}

const counter = countUpTo(3);
console.log(counter.next().value);
console.log(counter.next().value);
```

---

## 13. Module System (ES Modules)

**ES Modules** allow you to split your JavaScript code into smaller files and import/export functionality between them.

### Example:

```js
// utils.js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// main.js
import { add } from './utils.js';
console.log(add(2, 3));
```

---

## 14. Higher-Order Functions

A **higher-order function** is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as a result.

### Example with `map`:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```

### Example with `reduce`:

```js
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
console.log(sum);
```

---

## 15. Prototypes and Inheritance

JavaScript objects are based on prototypes. Each object has a prototype from which it can inherit properties and methods.

### Example:

```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

const john = new Person("John");
john.greet();
```

## Conclusion

Mastering advanced JavaScript concepts is essential for becoming a proficient developer. These concepts — such as closures, the `this` keyword, asynchronous programming, and modern ES features — will allow you to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. Keep practicing, experimenting, and building projects to solidify your understanding of JavaScript!
