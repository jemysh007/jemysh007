# Hosting a Laravel Project on Ubuntu Server with Nginx, SSL, and `yourdomain.in` Domain

This guide explains how to set up a Laravel project on an Ubuntu server with **Nginx** as the web server, **Let's Encrypt SSL** for secure connections, and configuring the **yourdomain.in** domain to point to your application.

## Prerequisites

- A blank Ubuntu server (Ubuntu 20.04 or later).
- SSH access to the server.
- A GitHub repository containing your Laravel project.
- A domain name **yourdomain.in** pointing to your serverâ€™s IP address.
- Basic knowledge of the command line and server management.

## Step 0: SSH Login to the Server

Log in to your Ubuntu server via SSH using the following command. Replace `your-server-ip` with the IP address of your server and `your-username` with your username (e.g., `ubuntu` or `root`):

```bash
ssh your-username@your-server-ip
```

For example:

```bash
ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.1
```

If you're using an SSH key for authentication, specify the private key file with the `-i` option:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your/private-key.pem your-username@your-server-ip
```

## Step 1: Update and Upgrade the System

Before starting, make sure the server is up-to-date.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Step 2: Install Nginx and PHP

Laravel requires PHP and Nginx. Follow these steps to install them:

1. **Install Nginx**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```

2. **Install PHP and Required Extensions**

   Laravel requires PHP 8.1 or higher. Run the following commands to install PHP and the necessary extensions:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install php-fpm php-cli php-mbstring php-xml php-curl php-mysql php-zip php-bcmath php-json
   ```

3. **Verify PHP Installation**

   Check the installed version of PHP:

   ```bash
   php -v
   ```

## Step 3: Install Git

If Git is not installed, run the following command to install it:

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

## Step 4: Clone Your Laravel Project from GitHub

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**

   Replace `your-repository-url` with the URL of your GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/username/your-laravel-project.git`).

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/your-laravel-project.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd your-laravel-project
   ```

## Step 5: Configure the `.env` File

1. **Create the `.env` File**

   If the `.env` file doesn't exist, create one by copying the `.env.example` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit the `.env` File**

   Use a text editor to configure the `.env` file with your database and other necessary configurations:

   ```bash
   nano .env
   ```

   Update the following values (example):

   - `DB_CONNECTION=mysql`
   - `DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`
   - `DB_PORT=3306`
   - `DB_DATABASE=your_database`
   - `DB_USERNAME=your_db_user`
   - `DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password`

   Save the file after making changes (`Ctrl+X` to exit and `Y` to confirm).

## Step 6: Install Composer

Laravel uses Composer for dependency management. Install Composer globally on your server:

1. **Download Composer**

   ```bash
   curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
   ```

2. **Move Composer to Global Directory**

   ```bash
   sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
   ```

3. **Verify Composer Installation**

   ```bash
   composer --version
   ```

## Step 7: Install Laravel Dependencies

Now, install the necessary Laravel dependencies using Composer:

```bash
composer install
```

## Step 8: Set Permissions for Laravel

Ensure that the appropriate permissions are set for the Laravel project:

1. **Set Permissions on Storage and Bootstrap Directories**

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/your-laravel-project/storage
   sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/your-laravel-project/bootstrap/cache
   ```

2. **Make Directories Writable**

   ```bash
   sudo chmod -R 775 /path/to/your-laravel-project/storage
   sudo chmod -R 775 /path/to/your-laravel-project/bootstrap/cache
   ```

## Step 9: Run Migrations and Seed Database

1. **Run Migrations**

   To apply database migrations, run:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

2. **Run Database Seeders (Optional)**

   If you have seeders set up, run the following command to populate your database:

   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

## Step 10: Configure Nginx as a Web Server

1. **Create a New Nginx Configuration File**

   Create a new Nginx configuration file for **yourdomain.in**:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.in
   ```

   Add the following configuration:

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name yourdomain.in www.yourdomain.in;

       root /path/to/your-laravel-project/public;
       index index.php index.html index.htm;

       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
       }

       location ~ \.php$ {
           include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
           fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
           fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
           include fastcgi_params;
       }

       location ~ /\.ht {
           deny all;
       }

       error_log  /var/log/nginx/yourdomain.in_error.log;
       access_log /var/log/nginx/yourdomain.in_access.log;
   }
   ```

2. **Enable the Site and Restart Nginx**

   Enable the site configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```

   Test the Nginx configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

   If the test is successful, restart Nginx:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

3. **Allow HTTP Traffic Through the Firewall**

   If you're using `ufw`, allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic:

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
   ```

## Step 11: Set Up SSL with Let's Encrypt

1. **Install Certbot and Nginx Plugin**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
   ```

2. **Obtain SSL Certificate**

   Run the following command to obtain and install the SSL certificate for **yourdomain.in**:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.in -d www.yourdomain.in
   ```

3. **Verify SSL Installation**

   Certbot will automatically configure SSL. Verify by visiting `https://yourdomain.in`.

4. **Automatic SSL Certificate Renewal**

   Certbot will handle automatic renewals. You can test the renewal process with:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

## Step 12: Access the Application

Visit `https://yourdomain.in` in your browser to access your Laravel application securely over HTTPS.

## Conclusion

With these steps, you have:

1. Set up Nginx to serve your Laravel application.
2. Configured your `.env` file for database and environment settings.
3. Applied Laravel migrations and database seeders.
4. Configured SSL using Let's Encrypt.
